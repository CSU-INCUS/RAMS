Note: This simulation had some strong waves in the model in the stratosphere. They did not seem to propogate into the troposphere or impact the convection, and it was difficult to assess if they were physical or not. Given that they did not seem to impact the tropospheric convection and strong waves are often present in regions of high terrain, like this case, we decided to keep this simulation.
